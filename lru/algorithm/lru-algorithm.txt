Algorithm: LRU (Least Recently Used) Page Replacement

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Read the number of pages.

Step 3: Read the page reference string.

Step 4: Read the number of frames.

Step 5: Initialize all frames to empty (−1) and initialize the time counter for each frame to 0.

Step 6: Initialize:

hits = 0

misses = 0

counter = 0

Step 7: For each page in the reference string, perform the following steps:

  Step 7.1: Check whether the page is already present in any frame.

  Step 7.2: If the page is found in a frame (HIT):

Increment hits.

Increment counter.

Update the time of the corresponding frame with the current counter value.

No replacement is performed.

  Step 7.3: Else (page not found – MISS):

Increment misses.

    Step 7.3.1: Check for an empty frame.

If an empty frame is available:

Insert the page into the empty frame.

Increment counter.

Update the time of that frame.

    Step 7.3.2: If no empty frame is available:

Find the frame with the least recent usage time.

Replace that frame with the new page.

Increment counter.

Update the time of the replaced frame.

  Step 7.4: Display the current page number, hit/miss status, action taken, and the contents of all frames in tabular format.

Step 8: After processing all pages, calculate:

Hit Ratio = hits / (hits + misses)


Step 9: Display the total number of hits, total number of misses, and the hit ratio.

Step 10: Stop.
