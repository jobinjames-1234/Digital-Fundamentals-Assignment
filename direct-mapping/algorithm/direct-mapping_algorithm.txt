Algorithm: Direct Mapping Cache Memory

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Read the cache size.

Step 3: Read the number of memory block references.

Step 4: Read the memory block reference string.

Step 5: Initialize all cache lines as empty by setting their tags to −1.

Step 6: Initialize:

hits = 0

misses = 0

Step 7: For each memory block in the reference string, perform the following steps:

  Step 7.1: Calculate the cache line index using:
    Index = BlockNumber % CacheSize

  Step 7.2: Calculate the tag using:
    Tag = BlockNumber / CacheSize

  Step 7.3: Compare the calculated tag with the tag stored in the cache line at the computed index.

  Step 7.4: If the tags match:

Increment hits.

Mark the access as HIT.

No change is made to the cache.

  Step 7.5: Else (tags do not match):

Increment misses.

Mark the access as MISS.

Load the memory block into the computed cache line.

Update the tag stored in that cache line.

  Step 7.6: Display the block number, index, tag, hit/miss status, action taken, and the current cache contents in tabular form.

Step 8: After processing all memory blocks, calculate:

Hit Ratio = hits / (hits + misses)


Step 9: Display the total number of hits, total number of misses, and the hit ratio.

Step 10: Stop.
