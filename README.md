# Queue Implementation in C
A simple C program demonstrating the fundamentals of the Queue data structure using the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

## Overview
This project implements a basic array-based queue and simulates common queue operations such as insertion, deletion, viewing the front element, and displaying all queue elements.

This program helps beginners understand:
- How queues work  
- How front and rear pointers update  
- Overflow and underflow conditions  
- FIFO behavior in data structures


## Queue Structure
The queue uses an array and maintains two pointers:

- front – Index of the first element  
- rear – Index of the last element  

### Queue Operations
- Enqueue – Insert an element  
- Dequeue – Remove an element  
- Peek – View the first element  
- Display – Show all elements  
- Handles Queue Overflow and Queue Underflow

## How It Works
A queue follows the FIFO principle:
