Algorithm: Associative Mapping with FIFO Replacement

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Read the number of cache lines.

Step 3: Read the block size (number of words per block).

Step 4: Read the number of memory addresses and the reference string.

Step 5: Initialize all cache tags to empty (−1).

Step 6: Initialize the following variables:
    a. hits = 0
    b. misses = 0
    c. filled = 0
    d. fifoIndex = 0

Step 7: For each memory address in the reference string, perform the following steps:

  Step 7.1: Calculate the TAG and WORD fields as:
    TAG = address / blockSize
    WORD = address % blockSize

  Step 7.2: Compare the calculated TAG with all cache tags (associative search).

  Step 7.3: If a matching TAG is found:
    a. Increment hits.
    b. Mark the access as HIT.
    c. No replacement is performed.

  Step 7.4: Else (TAG not found):
    a. Increment misses.
    b. Mark the access as MISS.

    Step 7.4.1: If the cache is not full:
      – Insert the TAG into the next free cache line.
      – Increment filled.

    Step 7.4.2: Else (cache is full):
      – Replace the TAG in the cache line pointed by fifoIndex.
      – Update
        fifoIndex = (fifoIndex + 1) mod cacheLines.

  Step 7.5: Display the address, TAG, WORD, hit/miss status, FIFO action, and current cache contents in tabular form.

Step 8: After processing all memory addresses, calculate:
    Hit Ratio = hits / (hits + misses).

Step 9: Display total hits, total misses, and hit ratio.

Step 10: Stop.
