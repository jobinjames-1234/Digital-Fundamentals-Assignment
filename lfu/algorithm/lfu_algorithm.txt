ALGORITHM – LFU PAGE REPLACEMENT (with LRU Tie-Breaker)

step 1: Start the program.

step 2: Read the number of page references and the frame capacity.

step 3: Initialize three arrays for each frame position:
   • frames[i] = -1 to show empty frame
   • freq[i] = 0 to store how many times each page was used
   • time_stamp[i] = 0 to store the last-used time for tie-breaking

step 4: Set time_counter = 0, hits = 0, and misses = 0.

step 5: For each page reference in the input sequence, repeat steps 6–17.

step 6: Increase the global time counter (time_counter++).

step 7: Check whether the current page is already present in any frame.
 • If found → it is a hit
 • If not found → it is a miss

Handling a HIT

step 8: If the page is found in some frame:
 • Increment its frequency value (freq[index]++)
 • Update its timestamp (time_stamp[index] = time_counter)
 • Increase hit counter (hits++)
 • Display frame contents
 • Go to next page reference

Handling a MISS

step 9: Increase miss counter (misses++).

step 10: Check if there is any empty frame slot.
 • If an empty frame exists → place the new page there.
 • Set freq = 1 and update timestamp.

step 11: If no empty frame exists, apply LFU replacement policy:

Victim Selection Rule

step 12: Among all frames, find the page with the smallest frequency.

step 13: If multiple pages have the same minimum frequency, break the tie using:
 → oldest timestamp (least recently used among them)

step 14: Choose the victim frame and replace it with the new page.

step 15: Set the new page’s frequency to 1 and update its timestamp.

step 16: Display the frame contents after placement or replacement.

End of Processing

step 17: After all page references are processed, calculate:
 • Total references
 • Total hits
 • Total misses
 • Hit ratio = (hits / total references) × 100

step 18: Display the simulation summary.

step 19: Stop the program.
